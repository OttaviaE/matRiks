\title{Coordinates of a maxi}
\usage{
maxi(size.x = 8, size.y = 4, pos.x = 0, shd = NA, lty = 1, lwd = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{size.x}{numeric, define the semi-major axis of the ellipse for the polygon(s) within which the figure is inscribed. Default is 8}

\item{size.y}{numeric, define the semi-minor axis of the ellipse for the polygon(s) within which the figure is inscribed. Default is 4.}

\item{pos.x}{numeric, define the position on the x axis. Default is 0.}

\item{shd}{character, define the color of the figure. Default is NA, which results in a transparent figure}

\item{lty}{integer, define the line type of the figure, default is 1 (solid line).}

\item{lwd}{integer, define the line width of the figure. Default is 3.}
}
\value{
Return the coordinates for drawing a maxi
}
\description{
Define the coordinates for drawing a maxi (i.e., a cross composed of four lucks)
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# return the default coordinates for drawing a maxi
maxi()

# change the coordinates for drawing a smaller maxi

maxi(size.x = 5)
}
