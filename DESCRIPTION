Description: This package creates Raven-like matrices according to different rules and the response list associated to the matrix. 
    The package can generate 4-cell and 9-cell matrices, along with a response list of 11 elements (the correct response + 10 distractros).
    The matrices can be generated according to both logical rules (i.e., the relastionships between the elements in the matrix are manipulated to create the matrix) and visuo-spatial rules (i.e., the visual or spatial charcateristics of the elements are manipulated to generate the matrix).
    The graphical elements of the matRiks package are based on the [DescTools] package.
